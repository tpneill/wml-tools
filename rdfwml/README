This is a simple converter for Netscape RDF channel files to small WML
decks which contain a small card with each item. The CGI variant just adds
the correct Content-Type header and works out the file to parse from the
QUERY_STRING variable.

To use rdfwml just call it with an RDF file (one from Slashdot is
provided).

To use rdfwml.cgi, link it like:
