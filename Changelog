18/3/2018 - v0.0.5

  * Relicensed under GPL by request
  * Removed old sample cruft
  * Very unlikely to actually compile on any modern system

31/1/2000 - v0.0.4

  * wmlc and wmlhtml now use the correct variable type for XML attribute
    pointers (xmlAttrPtr, not struct xmlAttr*). Now they will compile with
    newer versions of libxml.
  * Added wmlhtml to Makefile.in. Thanks to Peter Hanecak for pointing out
    this glaring omission (oops :).

14/12/1999 - v0.0.3

  * wmld now uses the string table properly (oops) and can deal with
    references to the table from both strings and variable names. I'd say
    that this is no longer alpha code and could probably be used with
    reasonable success.
  * Remebered to change the version number in the configure script.

13/12/1999 - v0.0.2

  * wmld now parses the string table and can use it accordingly. The code
    for this was missing from my copy of the bytecode specifications.
    Please note that all documentation relating to WML is gratefully
    accepted!
  * Added wmlhtml - a simple WML to HTML converter. This is just a quick
    hack and doesn't do a great job but gives a better idea than wmlv of
    how a WML deck will look.

 10/12/1999 - v0.0.1

  * First public release
  * Added files LICENSE and COPYRIGHT
  * wmlc now generates bytecode which now works in Nokia's WAP toolkit and
    Ericsson's WAP SDK. Most of the time, anyway
  * Fixed rdfwml to deal with <, > or $ in the input and fix accordingly

9/12/1999 - v0.0.0

  * First noted build
  * wmld, wmlv, wbmp2xpm and rdfwml all compile
  * wmlc does nasty things
