At the moment this is a simple WML bytecode decompiler, wmld. This has
been built out of the few WML bytecode references I have (they are 
incredibly difficult to get a hold of without having to sign your life
away on licensing agreements or paying ridiculous amounts of cash for).

The decompiler can now handle value attributes properly, inline strings,
the string table (with references by normal text or by variable name) and
can now decode bytecode to useable WML code with just about everything I
can throw at it.

I'd probably say that this isn't alpha code anymore. It's now beta. It
stops being beta when I test it with a LOT more bytecode.
