This is a very simple text-based WML deck viewer. It doesn't have any
concept of WMLscript, definable widgets, images or tables. It just runs
through the source putting it out as it thinks is best.

Use it as "wmlv file.wml [card]" where [card] is an optional card to show
from the deck (default is the first encountered).

The end result should see the output from wmld being passed to here,
thereby creating a viewer which can handle bytecode too.

An X version of this is being planned which should be able to handle the
definable widgets, images and tables. WMLscript is still beyond me at the
minute.
