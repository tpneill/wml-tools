This is a basic WML compiler. It takes the WML source and compiles into
WML bytecode ready for transmission to a WAP device.

It is quite basic and has a lot of limitations, but things it can compile
can be decompiled by wmld and vice versa.

So long as scripts and variables aren't involved, the pages compiled seem
to work reasonably well in Nokia's WAP Toolkit and Ericsson's WAP SDK. It
isn't most efficient, however, and the bytecode will be larger than other
compilers. Optimisation is Coming Soon(tm).

In order to compile bytecode in which simple scripts can work there needs
to be a mechanism for building up the string table and also finding out
what tag is appropriate (other compilers use WMLG_STR_T, WMLG_EXT_T_2 or
WMLG_EXT_I_2 to specify that a variable is coming and I don't know which
one to use - or even if it makes a difference)
