# wml-tools

This is a collection of tools designed to deal with WAP WML files from the 1999/2000 era.

I wrote these 19 years ago because I was annoyed that there were no tools like this on Linux, then forgot about them. I've had a request to relicense them so I see no reason not to.

It is incredibly unlikely that these will actually compile under a modern distro.
