These are tools for dealing with WBMP files - WAP bitmaps.

These files are really simple - the first two bytes contain version
information (I think) which at the minute is set to 0. The 3rd byte
contains the width and the 4th byte the height (I guess this makes WBMP
images max 255x255 pixels then).

From the 5th byte onwards they are simply byte-padded binary encoded 1-bit
images - 1 for white, 0 for black.

wbmp2xpm generates 1-bit XPM files from WBMP files. An example WBMP file
is included (logo.wbmp).

Coming soon : something useful (i.e. a WBMP creator)
